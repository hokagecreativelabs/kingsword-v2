          <div className="text-left space-y-4">
            <p>
            As we prepare for Supernatural Canada 2025, I reflect on the impact of meetings like this over the years. Every time we come into God&#39;s presence for weekly meetings, we are empowered and instructed; however, conventions like Supernatural Canada set us up for major boosts.

            </p>
            <p>
            As I reflect further, I think of how a woman regularly cleans her home and buys new furniture and paintings to keep the house how she wants it, but then she may embark on remodelling her entire home or kitchen giving it a whole new look. I think of Supernatural Canada as a spiritual remodeling - realignment to God&#39;s plan, getting a major supernatural boost for results and effectiveness. During and after every convention, there are always unusual testimonies and major shifts in people&#39;s lives - this year promises to be greater.

            </p>
            <p>
            To maximize a convention like Supernatural, it&#39;s important to be prepared - Heart, Mind and Body. Spending time in prayer and the Word of God to prepare our hearts, engaging our minds to envision possibilities in God&#39;s presence and clearing out schedules to avoid any distractions and support our focus to receive from God.

            </p>

              I&#39;ll like to invite you to join us as we get set for a Spiritual remodelling and encounters in God&#39;s presence. Let&#39;s come together, with prepared hearts, to receive all that God has for us.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&#39;s more than an event, it&#39;s a time to be transformed and shifted to our next level in God.
